# Software Requirements Specification for Real-Time Lecture Feedback System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for a Real-Time Feedback System for Lectures, designed to enhance communication between professors and students during lectures by providing immediate, anonymous feedback.

### 1.2 Intended Audience
This SRS is intended for developers, project managers, professors, and educational institution administrators involved in the development and implementation of the feedback system.

### 1.3 Project Scope
The Real-Time Lecture Feedback System aims to create a web and mobile platform that allows students to submit anonymous feedback during lectures and provides professors with actionable insights to adjust their teaching in real-time.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The system will consist of three main components:
1. A mobile application for students (iOS and Android)
2. A web application for professors
3. A backend system for data management and real-time processing

### 2.2 Product Features
- User registration and authentication for students and professors
- Real-time submission of questions and confusion indicators by students
- Live dashboard for professors showing aggregated feedback
- Analytics tools for post-lecture review
- Integration with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS)

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- Students: Attend lectures and provide real-time feedback
- Professors: Conduct lectures and receive real-time feedback
- Administrators: Manage the system and generate reports
